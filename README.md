# CTA-DDPG
    The raw data and figure plotting source code contained in this repository is used to evaluating the performance of CTA-DDPG algorithm proposed in the manuscript entiled "Collaborative Twin Actors Framework Using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for Flexible Batch Processes" submitted to Neural Networks with Paper ID "NEUNET-D-24-02400".
Due to confidentiality requirements associated with the project, it is not currently feasible to make the source code publicly available. Once the confidentiality period expires, we are eager to share the source code.
